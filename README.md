# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

Wherein I play with data structures and algorithms in JavaScript, with heavy help from [Philip Obosi's course](http://web.archive.org/web/20210616161653/https://scotch.io/courses/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-algorithms)

## Want to try this out yourself?

- Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Clone (or fork) the repository: type `git clone https://github.com/DevinCLane/js-algorithms.git` in your terminal, in the folder wherein you'd like to work
- run `cd js-algorithms` to move into the repository's folder on your machine
- run `npm install` to install the dependencies. (Your terminal will likely tell you there are old and deprecated dependencies. We will work with things as is for now.)
- Do some work. Then run `npm run test <name of folder of exercise>` to see how you did.
